### About

This is a very simple Android application which embeds a WebView. It simply shows the [Pjuu](https://pjuu.com) website.

In the future this will be expanded to show notifications that you have new alerts on the site.

This was build with the excellent Android Studio. This is the same repository that the Android app itself if build from.
